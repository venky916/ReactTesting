# 🎓 WHAT THIS DOES:
#
# On every push to main/develop:
# 1. ✅ Runs ESLint (but doesn't block if errors)
# 2. ✅ Runs TypeScript check (but doesn't block if errors)
# 3. ✅ Runs all unit tests with coverage
# 4. ✅ Runs all E2E tests
# 5. ✅ If on main branch AND all tests pass → Deploy to Vercel!
#
# On pull requests:
# 1-4 same as above
# 5. ❌ Don't deploy (only deploy from main)
#
# 🔥 KEY FEATURES:
# - continue-on-error: true → Lint/type errors don't block deploy (for now)
# - needs: [lint, test, e2e] → Deploy only if all jobs pass
# - if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' → Deploy only from main branch
# - Upload Playwright report on failure → Debug E2E failures
# - Codecov integration → Track coverage over time
#
# 💡 LATER (when ready):
# - Remove continue-on-error to enforce strict checks
# - Add build caching for faster runs
# - Add deployment notifications (Slack, Discord, etc.)
